Pollinators play a vital role in the health of our ecosystems, and our farm's Pollinator Project is our commitment to supporting these crucial species. We detail our efforts in creating pollinator-friendly habitats, from planting native flowering plants to reducing pesticide usage. These initiatives not only bolster the local biodiversity but also enhance crop pollination and yield.
